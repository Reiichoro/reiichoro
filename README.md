## 👋 About Me

I am an independent developer focused on **building small, controllable, and auditable systems**.

My work is shaped by real-world trade-offs rather than abstract ideals:

* choosing *simplicity over over-engineering*
* preferring *clear data models over magical abstractions*
* removing features when they increase long-term cost

I believe that **architecture is a series of conscious compromises**, not a pursuit of theoretical perfection.

---

## 🧠 Technical Focus

* **Backend**: PHP (FastAdmin), Java (Spring Boot)
* **Architecture**: CMS design, business systems, refactoring legacy code
* **Principles**:

  * Minimal but sufficient design
  * Explicit data models
  * Auditability over convenience
  * Long-term maintainability

---

## 🔁 Current Transition

I am currently transitioning from:

```
FastAdmin / PHP
        ↓
Spring Boot / Java
```

This is not a language switch for its own sake, but an exploration of:

* stronger engineering discipline
* clearer domain boundaries
* production-grade accounting and event-driven models

## 📦 Featured Project

### 🚀 reiichoro-article

**A lightweight & open CMS plugin for FastAdmin**

* Single-table CMS design (`fa_article`)
* Built for small to medium business systems
* An explicit alternative to heavy, multi-table CMS architectures

> Not a replacement for official CMS solutions,
> but a conscious answer to *"Do we really need one here?"*

## 🧩 What I Value in Software

* Code that can be explained without slides
* Databases you can reason about at 2 a.m.
* Systems that fail clearly instead of silently
* Tools that respect the developer's autonomy

Sometimes, **not adding a feature** is the most professional decision.

## 🌏 Location & Timezone

* 📍 Asia / Japan

## 🤝 Collaboration

I enjoy discussions around:

* system simplification
* refactoring decisions
* CMS and business system boundaries
* when *not* to use a framework

If you resonate with these ideas, feel free to explore my repositories or start a discussion.
